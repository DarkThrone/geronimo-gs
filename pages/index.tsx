              <h1>Hi there üëãüèª</h1>
              <p>I&#39;m Ger&oacute;nimo, also known as DarkThrone.</p>
              <p>
                I&#39;m a software engineer that likes computer graphics, music
                and video games. I&#39;ve spent most of my professional years
                working with the web and all that stuff like APIs and such.
                Lately I&#39;ve been doing quite a lot of React and Rust.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the day I work as a software engineer at{' '}
                <AtlassianSvg className="inline" style={{ height: 16 }} /> in
                the Growth team, where we try to connect our users with the
                right tools to empower them.
              </p>
              <p>
                On my free time I usually code for fun, work on some side
                project, play and record some music or simply play some games!
              </p>
              <p>
                I use this platform to share my thoughts and the side projects
                I&#39;m working on. Currently I&#39;m preparing a course about
                Rust! Sign up to the newsletter if you want me to keep you
                posted.
              </p>
              <p>DarkThrone&#39;s the name. Code is the game. Glad you came.</p>
