I've been putting off starting this blog for a long while. Not because I couldn't figure out what technology to use (well, yeah I couldn't) or because I would start building one over and over again (well, I DID). It was mostly because I wasn't feeling inspired to, I couldn't find the energy to do it.

In spite of my lack or energy and inspiration, I decided to look forward anyway and just start one step at a time, until I had something workable. I consider myself a perfectionist, but with this project a promised myself I would throw away all that obsession with having the perfect blog and deploy something at least workable and barely pleasant to the eyes.

Looking into different solutions for a few hours, I realise the cycle was repeating, I was falling into the same old habits. Determined to put a stop to this, I just grabbed Next.js, started a new project from scratch and went along figuring it what I could do to make it look like a blog.

I settled for very simple and basic features:
- Support for simple pages for some side projects
- Responsive
- Able to render Markdown with syntax highlight support
- Simple to maintain and deploy

Next.js checked most of this and for the rest I just needed Tailwind and an MDX renderer.

You can take a look at the end result [here](https://github.com/DarkThrone/geronimo.gs)
